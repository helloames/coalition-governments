# coalition-governments
My solution (modeling.ipynb) to the data problem from the final exam of POLISCI 189FS: Introduction to Machine Learning and Computational Models in the Social Sciences, taught by Professor Scott de Marchi at Duke University. Context of the data set (class_final_proportion.csv) and the prompt: students were supposed to model and predict the proportion of cabinet ministries each party gains. Each row of the CSV file represents an observation/data point of a party (from European parliamentary democracies and ministries), and the data show the rewards parties gain from forming a winning coalition government. model-interpretations.pdf is my write-up for the data problem.
